### **THE STORY SECTION**

THE ANCIENT WISDOM

Thirty birds set out to find the mythical Simurgh.
After crossing seven valleys of transformation,
they discovered the truth:
"Si murgh" means "thirty birds" in Persian.
They were what they sought.

You already have what you're looking for.
You just need to remember how to access it.
